## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows use venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Preparation


Place the raw data in the data/raw/ directory.
Run the data processing script to generate the processed dataset:

```bash
python src/data/make_dataset.py
```

## Feature Engineering


Run the feature engineering script to create and select the features required for the model:

```bash
python src/features/build_features.py
```

## Model Training


Train the Random Forest regression model:

```bash
python src/models/train_model.py
```

## Model Evaluation


Evaluate the model performance:

```bash
python src/models/evaluate_model.py
```

## Prediction


Use the trained model to make predictions:

```bash
python src/models/predict_model.py
```

## Project Workflow


**1. Data Collection and Integration**: Consolidate historical traffic records, weather data, road congestion indicators, and holiday schedules.
**2. Exploratory Data Analysis and Preprocessing**: Clean the data, handle missing values and outliers, and encode categorical variables.
**3. Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful variables, such as peak period indicators, road segment density, and holiday markers.
**4. Feature Selection**: Use methods like recursive feature elimination and mutual information scores to choose the most influential predictive factors.
**5. Model Training and Validation**: Split the dataset, train the Random Forest regressor, and optimize hyperparameters.
**6. Iterative Optimization and Evaluation**: Use cross-validation to ensure model reliability, and adjust the feature engineering process based on error analysis.
**7. Deployment and Continuous Monitoring**: Deploy the validated model into production and establish monitoring mechanisms to track its performance.
